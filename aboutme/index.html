    <h2>Matthew Leeper</h2>
    <p> My name is Matt Leeper. I am a single dad of 3 kids that keep me very busy. I have them half the time and also get them to school and and activities every day. </p>
    <p> I live in Las Vegas Nevada and work full time as a Realtor. I also work part time helping my brother rehab houses in Cedar City Utah. Between work, kids and school, I have very little free time.</p>
    <p> I love to camp with my kids and hate the summer heat of Las Vegas so I either take them campng in the mountains of southern UT or we head to Grandma's house in San Diego to get some beach time in. This is my second computer class and I am amazed at how quickly we are learning to actually make things. I look forward to meeting all of you.</p>
