      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        Page one
        People will come to my website to be able to research homes and the neighborhoods that are around them. I want to allow people to have a similar to Zillow experience with links to neighborhood statistics. This will enable them to do their own research on which neighborhoods they want to live in based on hard data that I will provide links to. I think people like to be able to do their own research and that is what the primary goal of this website will be. To keep people coming back and hopefully clicking on the contact us button. I would also like to include a link to schedule an appointment with an agent. Maybe eventually expanded to include the Agentâ€™s availability so that they can browse the agents and find one that has availability that works for their work schedule.
        On the main page I will have a link to obtain a estimated price for selling your home. This will be a form for them to fill out with their address and a way to contact them after I can link my MLS, I will be able to offer them an automated number with a more accurate number to be sent to them after an agent researches their property.
        
        Traffic
I ultimately plan to drive traffic through google ads, but I would like to have a very well laid out, and appealing website. If it is user friendly, I think that I will be able to have repeat visits. I plan to make it very easy to contact an agent through the website. Hopefully I can make it a very appealing website that is easy to navigate and will drive repeated visits. 

Links
I will need to include quite a few different links and this will take up the entirety of a page. Eventually I would like to have the top of this page a link to my MLS so that houses for sale can be searched and then researched all on the same page. 

Images
Images will correspond to what the links are and I will not use a lot of other images as I would like to eventually have links to the actual house listings and those will have their own pictures. Each link

      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        I plan on having a map section, links to crime stats, school information, tax information, parks and other neighborhood amenities. This will let people do research on their own so they can determine best neighborhoods. Other questions that I could answer here, would be, how long commutes would take. I would accomplish this by linking a google map, so that they can input their destination and see the distances. I would eventually like to link the houses for sale on the MLS, but that will be outside the scope of this class.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        I plan on having an about us page that will list each Realtor who works for the brokerage. The page will be dedicated to their experience and  each one will have a paragraph about why they would be a good choice as an agent. It will also list my experience and how to contact each of us. This page will expand as I add agents to my roster. It would also include a paragraph about their personal lives as well as any other information that helps people better identify with the agent
